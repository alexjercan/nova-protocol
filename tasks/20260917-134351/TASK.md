# Delete compatibility machinery and low-value verification

- STATUS: OPEN
- PRIORITY: 100
- TAGS: v0.14.0, refactor, verification

## User notes

- Treat Nova as the sole consumer of its internal crates and unshipped formats.
- Prefer breaking replacement and compiler-assisted refactors.
- Delete obsolete paths instead of adding compatibility layers.
- Reject missing required content instead of inventing fallback values.
- Keep runtime recovery only when it is intentional game behavior.
- Remove comments that narrate code or use vague agent language.
- Keep comments only for ownership, constraints, reasons, or explicit debt.
- Remove tests that pin prose, incidental paths, inventories, or implementation.
- Prefer unit tests for pure logic and validation.
- Prefer asserted examples, probe runs, bench play, and inspected frames for game
  behavior, player flows, and visuals.

## Delivery

1. Inventory compatibility adapters, implicit defaults, stale branches, weak
   comments, task citations, and low-value tests. Record each candidate and its
   consumers before deletion.
2. Separate invalid-authoring fallbacks from deliberate runtime behavior. Do not
   delete a runtime fallback only because its variable or comment says fallback.
3. Clean one subsystem at a time. Change the intended interface first, use
   compiler errors to find callers, update owned content, and delete dead code.
4. Replace weak verification only when the behavior still needs protection. Use
   the cheapest proof that observes the real failure mode.
5. Run affected checks only. Inspect generated content and rendered output when
   the claim depends on them.
6. Keep behavior changes, proof, decisions, and remaining limits in this task.

## Done when

- Required internal and content data fails clearly when absent or unknown.
- Removed internal APIs have no compatibility wrappers or dual paths.
- Remaining fallbacks document valid runtime behavior.
- Remaining comments state a concrete reason, constraint, owner, or debt.
- Remaining tests protect stable behavior rather than implementation trivia.
- Affected gameplay flows pass their asserted example, probe, or bench evidence.
- Invalidated docs and the v0.14.0 changelog describe the resulting behavior.
